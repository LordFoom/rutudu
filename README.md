# rutudu
The simple, tui rust to do list. You can say it roo-too-doo or rah-tah-dah, or even rah-too-doo!

Work in progress but you can:

* Make simple list, with entry text
* Sub lists.

Wanted a TUI based todo list with hierarchies that doesn't just cat to the console,
but allows navigation,collapsing, etc. Couldn't find one so here we are.

* a to add an item
* Ctrl+a to add a sub item
* Alt+a to add new parent
* x to cross out
* s to save as sqlite file 
* l to load (up/down to select, press right to open - need to still add enter to open)
