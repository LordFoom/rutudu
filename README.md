# rutudu
The simply amazing rust to do list! You say it roo-too-doo or rah-tah-dah - it means rust to do!

Work in progress but you can:

* Make simple list, with entryy
* Sub lists.

Want a TUI based todo list with hierarchies that doesn't just cat to the console,
but allows navigation,collapsing, etc.

* A to add an item
* Ctrl+A to add a sub item
* X to cross out
* S to save (broken)
* L to load (so broken)

Does not exist so making my own.
